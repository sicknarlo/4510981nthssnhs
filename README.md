###3. Database design

A local mixed martial arts (MMA) league has asked you to redesign their web page so they can market events and sell tickets. (Right now it's just a landing page with the league's phone number: 911.)

The league holds an event about once a month at one of a handful of regular venues. Every venue has a different capacity. Every event has between 8 and 12 fights. The fights are scheduled in a certain order but they won't start at a specific time.

The league has 10 weight classes, 5 each for men and women, with a minimum weight for each. Fights have two fighters, who both belong to the same weight class. After the fight is over, there has to be a record of the winner. Fights don't end in draws.

Design the data model for this client. Use any design tools you like. Save your model as text or a legible image file.
